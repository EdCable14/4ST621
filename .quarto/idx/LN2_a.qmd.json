We will continue in the journey to reach two very important results of probability theory - total probability law now and Bayes theorem in the next part.\n\nLet´s start with the simplest case: we have one random event B followed by the second random event A. Random event A is dependent on the random event B, meaning its conditional probabilities are different based on whether event B or its complement occurred: $P(A|B) \\not= P(A|\\bar{B})$.\n\nThe first question arises: what is (un)conditional probability of the random event A? If we think a little while about this, the four intersections create elementary sample space:\n\n$E=(A\\cap{B}, A\\cap{\\bar{B}}, \\bar{A}\\cap{B}), \\bar{A}\\cap{\\bar{B}})$.\n\nRandom event A is simply union: $A=(A\\cap{B})\\cup({A\\cap{\\bar{B}}})$.\n\nAnd since the two intersections are elementary, they are disjoint and the probability of such a union:\n\n$P(A)=P(A\\cap{B})+P({A\\cap{\\bar{B}}})$.\n\nIn simple terms, the random event A occurs if random event A occurs with B or with the complement to B, and total probability is the summation of the two possibilities.

Instead of the random event B and its complement, let´s now assume that the first random trial can end up in *k* various disjoint random events, which together fully partition the sample space of this random trial:\n\n$E=\\cup_{i=1}^kB_i$.\n\nHence, the summation of probabilities of $B_i$ is equal to one:\n\n$\\sum_{i=1}^k(P(B_i))=1$.\n\nThen we can follow the same logic as in the first case, where *k* = 2, and find out the general formula for total probability law:\n\n$P(A)=\\sum_{i=1}^k(P(B_i)*P(A|B_i))$.\n\nWe can interpret this formula - total probability is the weighted average of the conditional probabilities $P(A|B_i)$ with weights equal to respective probabilities of conditions $P(B_i)$.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nIn the previous part of the lecture notes, we defined conditional probability.
