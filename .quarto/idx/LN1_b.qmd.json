To overcome this limitation and solve new issuing problems, scholars in the 18th century started thinking about continuous sample spaces. This led to the generalisation called the geometric definition of probability, which can be expressed as\n\n$$\nP(A)=\\frac {V(A)}{V(E)}\n$$\n\nWhere the V operator represents continuous measure -- in one dimension length, in two dimensions area and in more dimensions simply volume.

Now, randomly drop a needle with a length of l onto this floor. How likely is the needle to lie across a line between two strips? This probability, assuming $l \\leq t$ was proved to be\n\n$$\nP(A)=\\frac {2*l}{\\pi*t}\n$$\n\nMuch later, this problem was turned around, and Buffon´s needle was used to estimate the value of $π$ by substituting relative frequency *p* for probability P(A):\n\n$$\nest(\\pi)=\\frac{2*l} {p *t}\n$$\n\nSubstituting relative frequency for probability is a trick available thanks to the laws describing convergences in probability and is the basis of the frequentist definition.\n\n### Frequentist definition of probability\n\nThe classical definition of probability stumbled upon a severe limitation -- its reliance on the principle of indifference, which might be justifiable in the games of chance but hardly so in other real-world instances.

This series of relative frequencies will converge (in probability) to its limit, the underlying probability of an event A.\n\n$$p_n(A) \\rightarrow P(A)$$We will deal with stochastic convergences later because these laws connect probability theory with statistics.\n\n### Axiomatic definition\n\nAround the same time R.A. Fischer or Richard von Misses (brother of not less famous Austrian economist Ludwig von Misses) were championing and rigorously proving frequentist definition and interpretation of probability, a completely new approach emerged: axiomatic definition, work of brilliant Russian mathematician A. N. Kolmogorov. This approach focused on the smallest basic set of rules, axioms, which can serve as a basis for all manipulations with probabilities.
